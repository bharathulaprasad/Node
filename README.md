# Node
My learnings with Node.js online

Node is ideal for Test driven development and Agile.

How to execute:

The main program is  hello-world.js.
we can call this using node as following: 

node hello-world.js

for checking syntax, we can install jshint using npm
npm install -g jshint --save

after installation run:

jshint .

This will check for errors in entire directory.
